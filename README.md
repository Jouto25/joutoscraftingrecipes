This is a datapack that adds more crafting recipes to enhance Minecraft. I made this for two reasons:

1. I wanted to do some datapack practice and figured a simple recipe datapack would be the best way to do it.
2. I wanted a datapack/mod that would combine many of the mods that include QoL crafting recipes into one mod.

**Please check the Gallery Tab so you can check the recipes the datapack adds.**

With that in mind, here's all the recipes this datapack adds:

- **Craftable Saddles**
  Now you'll be able to ride horses sooner!
  
- **Craftable Chainmail Armor**
  A recipe to make chainmail armor more convinent! Only uses iron nuggets.

- **New TNT Recipe**
  Based on Legundo's TNT recipe from his Sculk Horde videos.
  
- **Cobweb to String Recipe**
  Another way to get string.
  
- **Converting Rotten Flesh into Leather**
  Smelting rotten flesh into leather.
  
- **Blasting Raw Ore Blocks**
  Now you'll be able to blast metals much faster! Each block blasts twice as slow compared to smelting an ignot.
  
- **Blasting Sand to Glass**
  Quick glass making.
  
- **Blasting Clay and Clay Blocks into Bricks and Terracota**
  Now you'll have more bricks in less time!
  
- **Blasting Netherrack into Nether Bricks**
  A faster route to nether bricks!
  
- **Blasting Cobblestone to Stone**
  Faster way to get stone.
  
- **Stonecutting Amethyst Blocks to Amethyst Shards**
  Now you can get those shards another way. Keep in mind one block only cuts into one shard.


New recipes may be added depending on my free time and user suggestions. Please suggest any new recipes on the GitHub.

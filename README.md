This is a datapack that adds more crafting recipes to enhance Minecraft. I made this for two reasons:

1. I wanted to do some datapack practice and figured a simple recipe datapack would be the best way to do it.
2. I wanted a datapack/mod that would combine many of the mods that include QoL crafting recipes into one mod.


With that in mind, here's all the recipes this datapack adds:

- **Craftable Saddles**
  Now you'll be able to ride horses sooner!
  
- **Craftable Chainmail Armor**
  A recipe to make chainmail armor more convinent! Only uses iron nuggets.

- **New TNT Recipe**
  Based on Legundo's TNT recipe from his Sculk Horde videos.
  
- **Cobweb to String Recipe**
  Another way to get string.
  
- **Converting Rotten Flesh into Leather**
  Smelting rotten flesh into leather.
  
- **Blasting Raw Ore Blocks**
  Now you'll be able to blast metals much faster! Each block blasts twice as slow compared to smelting an ignot.
  
- **Blasting Sand to Glass**
  Quick glass making.
  
- **Blasting Clay and Clay Blocks into Bricks and Terracota**
  Now you'll have more bricks in less time!
  
- **Blasting Netherrack into Nether Bricks**
  A faster route to nether bricks!
  
- **Blasting Cobblestone to Stone**
  Faster way to get stone.
  
- **Stonecutting Amethyst Blocks to Amethyst Shards**
  Now you can get those shards another way. Keep in mind one block only cuts into one shard.
  
- **Convert Mushrooms into their respective Blocks**
  Easy way to get those mushroom blocks!
  
- **Blasting Cobbled Deepslate to Deepslate**
  Faster way to get deepslate.
  
- **Deepslate Stonecutting**
  Now you can use deepslate in stonecutters, not just cobbled deepslate!
  
- **Shapeless Bread, Paper, and Shulker Boxes**
  Now you can craft these items in a 2x2 grid!
  
- **Craft Clay Blocks back to Clay Blobs**
  A more convinent way to get clay blobs for bricks
  
- **Craft Quartz Blocks back to Quartz**
  You can now convert quartz blocks back, just like the other metal blocks.
  
- **Convert Melon Slices to a Melon**
  For more melons in storage.
